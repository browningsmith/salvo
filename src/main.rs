 *                 Description: This program allows the user to play a Battleship-like game against
 *                              the CPU, or against a human opponent. The game board is displayed
 *                              in the console using lines and dashes to make the classic 10x10
 *                              board. Ships are denoted by capital letters. A miss is denoted
 *                              by the '~' symbol (it looks like a wave, doesn't it!). A hit is
 *                              denoted by a 'X' symbol. The user interfaces with the game by typing
 *                              commands into the console when prompted.
 *
 *                       Input: None
 *                      Output: None
 *
 * Example Execution (Windows): .\salvo.exe
 * 
 * This is the main.rs file, and it's only purpose is to create a new Salvo game and call run_game()
 * from lib.rs. lib.rs contains the bulk of the game logic and terminal interfacing.
